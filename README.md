Data Cleaning:
Dealt with missing values and selecting the relevant features for answering our Research questions. Also, dealt with outliers by taking the 95% of the data and omitting the outliers. 

Machine Learning Algorithms used on the datasets:
- Clustering : Applied K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for obtained the group of clusters. Also, used PCA dimension reduction technique in order to reduce the dimension of the data before applying K-Means Cluster analysis.
